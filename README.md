# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

The project for the week was to create a backend application that would run in the command line. The application accepts user input for an employee such as a Manager, Engineer and Intern. Depending on the role of the employee there will be specific questions for the user to answer, such as 'GitHub' for engineer and 'School' for Intern. After the user answers all of the prompted questions the HTML and CSS page are then created in the 'dist' directory.
